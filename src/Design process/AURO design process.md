# AURO: A Design & Society Case Study

**Module:** Design and Society  
**Institution:** National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT)  

### Project Team
*   **Harsh Sharma (Lead Designer & Project Architect)**
*   Mansha Verma
*   Purnima Sachan
*   Shreya Jauhari
*   Tanya Mangla

### Individual Contribution: Harsh Sharma
As the **Lead Designer**, Harsh Sharma spearheaded the creative and technical execution of AURO. Key contributions include:
*   **Concept Generation:** Architected the "5 Elements" framework and the "Reclaimers" lore, transforming abstract environmental issues into a cohesive game mythology.
*   **Design Process Flow:** Defined the chronological case study structure and mapped the critical pivot from Game Design to Trailer Production.
*   **Script & Dialogues:** Authored the 3-Act trailer script and wrote the "Mother Earth" narration, focusing on emotional hooks and pacing.
*   **Character & Visual Design:** Directed the visual identity, managing the iterative AI prompting process to ensure character consistency (Auro's glowing veins, the Guides' distinct attire) across varying biomes.
*   **Asset Production:** Oversaw the generation of all media assets—from static concept art and video sequences to synthetic sound effects and voiceovers.
*   **Final Production:** Conducted the final edit in Premiere Pro, synthesizing visuals, audio, and narrative into the final "Vertical Slice" trailer.

## 1. The Genesis: The Design & Society Challenge
The project began as a capstone assignment for the **"Design and Society"** module. We were challenged to use design interventions to address a pressing societal issue, given three strategic directions:
1.  **Redesign** an existing object or product.
2.  **Design a System** to solve a societal problem.
3.  **Educate by Design.**

**The Strategic Choice:**
We chose **"Educate by Design."** We identified a critical gap: while adults often have fixed habits, the next generation (Gen Alpha and Gen Z) are the future stewards of the planet. To create lasting change regarding climate change, we needed to instill environmental values early—not through textbooks, but through *agency* and *emotional connection*.

## 2. Phase 1: Research & Strategy (The "Why")
We conducted extensive secondary research into learning methodologies and child psychology (specifically **Piaget’s** cognitive stages and **Vygotsky’s** social development theory).

*   **The Insight:** Passive learning (lectures, reading) has low retention for complex systemic issues. **Active learning**, where the user sees the consequences of their actions, creates deep emotional connections.
*   **The Solution: Gamification.**
    *   We analyzed successful titles like **Minecraft** (Creative Freedom), **Animal Crossing** (Community/Pacing), and **SimCity** (Resource Management).
    *   **Conclusion:** We would build a **Sustainability Simulation Game** where players actively restore a broken world, learning through doing.

## 3. Phase 2: Ideation & Concept Architecture (The "What")
With the medium decided, we needed a core concept that connected real-world sustainability to engaging gameplay.

### 3.1 Mapping the Problem Space
We brainstormed *where* sustainability is most needed. We realized pollution wasn't isolated; it attacks the fundamental building blocks of the planet.
*   **Water:** Polluted by microplastics and oil spills.
*   **Air:** Choked by smog and industrial emissions.
*   **Earth:** Barren from erosion and deforestation.
*   **Fire:** Uncontrollable wildfires due to climate change.
*   **Space:** Cluttered with orbital debris ("Space Junk").

### 3.2 The "Elemental" Breakthrough
This led to our core design pillar: **The 5 Elements.**
Instead of a generic "cleanup" game, we conceptualized a mythic narrative where Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space themselves are corrupted.

### 3.3 Character Evolution
*   **Initial Concept:** "Echo of Rebirth" featuring a humanoid protagonist made of synthetic waste.
*   **Refinement:** To create a stronger emotional anchor for the target audience (kids), we evolved the protagonist into **AURO**, a young human boy mutated by the elements. This made him relatable—a vulnerable survivor gaining mastery over nature.

## 4. Phase 3: The Game Design Specification (The "How")
We detailed the game mechanics to ensure they were fun first, educational second.

### 4.1 The Core Loop: Exploration -> Restoration -> Mastery
The game follows a cycle where players enter a corrupted biome, identify the source of pollution, and use elemental powers to restore it.
*   **Level 1 (Water):** Cleansing the "Plastic Sea" and defeating the *Plastic Leviathan*.
*   **Level 2 (Air):** Liberating the "Smog Chasm" and battling the *Storm Tyrant*.
*   **Level 3 (Fire):** Taming the "Scorched Lands" and the *Infernal Wyrm*.
*   **Level 4 (Earth):** Healing the "Barren Lands" and the *Colossus of Decay*.
*   **Level 5 (Space):** Stabilizing the "Cosmic Void" and the *Void Gargoyle*.

### 4.2 Key Mechanics
*   **The "Elemental Conduit":** Auro's gauntlet acts as the primary UI tool, allowing players to switch between powers naturally (e.g., swapping from *Wind* to clear smog, to *Water* to irrigate soil).
*   **Skill Tree:** We designed branching paths for each element. Players cannot just "control" nature immediately; they must unlock understanding first (e.g., unlocking *Reforestation Pulse* only after mastering *Soil Analysis*).
*   **HUD Design:** We opted for a minimalist, organic interface—health bars that look like vines or energy flows—to maintain immersion.

## 5. Phase 4: The Production Pivot (The Trailer)
Since building a full AAA game was outside the scope of the semester, we focused on producing a high-fidelity **Cinematic Trailer** as a proof-of-concept ("Vertical Slice").

### 5.1 Narrative Storyboarding
We researched **Cinematic Storytelling** and structured the trailer into a 3-Act Hero's Journey:
*   **Act 1 (The Hook):** The Desolation. The Mother's Sacrifice. The Birth of Auro.
*   **Act 2 (The Journey):** Showcasing the "Reclaimers" (Mentors) and the diverse Biomes.
*   **Act 3 (The Climax):** The confrontation with "The Core" (a sentient mass of pollution).

## 6. Phase 5: The Tech Stack (AI-Augmented Production)
In 2024, we utilized a cutting-edge suite of AI tools to maximize efficiency and achieve a "big studio" look with a small team.

*   **Ideation:** **ChatGPT** for world-building, lore refinement, and script polishing.
*   **Visuals:** **Leonardo.ai** was the engine for our art direction. We used it to generate consistent character sheets for Auro and the Elemental Guides, as well as the high-contrast environment concepts (Corrupted vs. Restored biomes).
*   **Video:** **Hailuo AI** and **Sora** allowed us to turn our static concepts into moving cinematic shots, breathing life into the "Plastic Sea" and the "Scorched Lands."
*   **Audio:** **ElevenLabs** generated the voice of "Mother Earth," creating a narrator that sounded ancient, emotional, and guiding.

## 7. Final Production
The final assembly was done in **Adobe Premiere Pro**. We layered the "Mother Earth" voiceover with swelling orchestral scores and synchronized visual transitions (wipes, fades) to guide the viewer's emotion—starting with slow, wide shots of desolation and ramping up to fast cuts for action sequences.

## 8. Conclusion
The **AURO** project demonstrates that with the right intent and the right tools, a small team can produce "AAA-quality" conceptual work. We successfully answered the "Design and Society" brief by creating a compelling, gamified vision of sustainability that empowers the next generation to reclaim their future.
